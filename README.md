#### A Java Toolkit for Git, testing, ORM and web built from scratch with only the standard library.

This is an educational project to help gain a more robust understanding of Java.
Scope (What will be built):

- DSA Library (Core)
- Git clone
- Custom Test Framework
- ORM
- Webserver

All built only using the Java Standard library, no 3rd party libraries. Any additional tools that are needed will be built. With some exceptions like: JMH, JFR and jcmd.

To ensure that there is actual growth and learning is happening, I have rules in place:

- No AI - No generated code, assistance/guidance from any AI model is allowed.
- Limited Internet - Initial research from primary sources only - Limited blogs, No StackOverflow.
- All DSA will be built - With exception to crypto algorithms (Like SHA that will be used in the Git project, I might change my mind on this and attempt to roll it myself).

For transparency, AI was used to start the planning of this project to point me in some direction on resources to use.

Initial Resources (I will add new resources to the list as I need them):

- Effective Java - Joshua Bloch
- Core Java Vol I & II - Cay Horstmann
- Java Performance: The Definitive Guide - Scott Oaks
- Java Concurrency in Practice - Brain Goetz
- Pro Git - Scott Chacon - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- Official documentation like: JUnit 5 User Guide, JDBC official docs, JPA spec

I do not know how long this is going to take me to complete (or if I will even complete 1 of the projects). And inspiration hit me a week going away for holiday (I will likely only start seriously working on this when I am back).
